# The Dashboard -> Manually contructed

Studying the Factory.js that parses out Blocks syntax i am confident we can build a platform with draggable widgets to build a dashboard at run-time.

Strategy is to :

- build such a dashboard using Drag, Drop & resize
- Add widgets 
- dash state management
- construct a property editor that exposes (part of) the Widget/control's internal parameters via thid tool.

A great tool that works in a similar fashion is TinkerCAD Circuits UI

# The Widget -> BLOCKS workflow

In completion of the whole Widgets & Blocks integration discussion, here is the workflow.

My opinion everything on the Visual side of an App is actually a widget, made out of one or more controls combined with some borders and container and powered up with some core functionality (from the platform)

Each widget is fully self-contained app that can interact actively with other widgets (if capable) and the Cavalion Core.
