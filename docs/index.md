# 1. Project Title: [%Title]

Group name: leadHers
Project Hack O'mation: hydropower plant
Electricity can be generated in different ways. One of the ways is through hydropower.
We are building a small bluewater Hydropower that can be use by everyone. It will be inexpensive so everybody can buy it.
This will be use to generate electricity for small devices when you are outdoor. This can be very usefull when you are at a place with no electricity. It has a magnet coupling so it
is easy to switch propellers.
